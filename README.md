# Resume builder on React

## Key features
- The form in the builder is dynamic. This means you add as many skills, education and practical experiences as you want. Just click on a button in each section to add a new entry.
- Sections are optional. If you don't specify, say, practical experience, the whole section won't be displayed in the end result.
- You can edit the result after submitting.
